# Specification Phase Exercise

A little exercise to get started with the specification phase of the software development lifecycle. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## [Ideation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uuLf8-Hde8k2mycQzfeQlwOh2JYok_Nh9vkbHjUwj-4/edit) Main Points

* We want to create a mobile app that can manage minigames for users.
* The app should contain a variety of minigames to choose from for the user to install.
* Allow easy removal of minigames that are installed using this mobile app.
* The downloaded minigame could either be played inside the mobile app, outside the mobile app (like a regular game app on the mobile phone), or both.
* There should be a comment section for each minigame that the mobile app features, where users can see and give comments on minigames.
* This app would be helpful for users who either have no minigames and want to play some, or a lot of minigames and want an app to manage their minigames.
