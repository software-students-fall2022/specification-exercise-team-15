# Specification Phase Exercise

A little exercise to get started with the specification phase of the software development lifecycle. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## [Ideation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yn09Uu0B0mmxNh73a2RAwO3KOEOL9FLK4nViyHqaSU4/edit) Main Points

* We want to create a mobile app that can manage minigames for users.
* The app should contain a variety of minigames to choose from for the user to install.
* Allow easy installation and deletion of minigames using this app.
* This app would be helpful for users who either have no minigames and want to play some, or a lot of minigames and feel troubled managing them on mobile.
